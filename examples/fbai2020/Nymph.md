Nymph is a natural language theorem prover that allows the user to state and write proofs of logical and mathematical theorems using natural language sentences instead of the artificial language of propositional and first-order logic. 
The language used in discussing and teaching mathematics is usually a combination of unambiguous formal expressions with informal statements and instructions where many surface forms can map to the same meaning. Sylph-N uses Wit.ai to understand the role the different consitituents in a natural language statement play and to extract the formal expressions which can then be parsed and interpreted by the Sylph theorem prover 

Sylph-N uses Wit.ai to translate sentences into proof strules which are then passed to the Sylph theorem prover.
Since Wit.ai has a built-in entity for math expressions, we can use Wit.ai to tell us what roles different expressions play in different senteces 

e.g Show that logical implication is defined by 
and translates 

in an argument and uses the
Sylph theorem prover

Sylph-N can also prove textual entailment between sentences by using Wit.ai to extract the logical form of natural language sentences and sending the extracted logical formula to Sylph where it can be proved according to the axioms and rules of a particualar thory.
