## About
.NET bindings for the TensorFlow 2 [C API](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c). These are low-level bindings suitable for creating higher-level idiomatic interfaces to TensorFlow 2 in .NET languages like C# and F#.

## Implementation
* [C# bindings](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/blob/master/src/Fabrics/tf/Sylvester.tf.Api/TensorFlow.cs) autogenerated from the TensorFlow [C header](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/c/c_api.h) files using [CppSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CppSharp/).
* C# [op definitions](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/blob/master/src/Fabrics/tf/Sylvester.tf.Api/Ops.g.cs?raw=true) autogenerated from the TensorFlow 2 runtime op definitions. The [generator](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/tree/master/src/Fabrics/tf/Sylvester.tf.OpGen) is based on the one created by Miguel de Icaza for [TensorFlowSharp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TensorFlowSharp).
* [Tensor](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/blob/master/src/Fabrics/tf/Sylvester.tf.Api/Tensor.cs) object implementation that uses zero-copy reinterpretation of existing .NET multi-dimensional arrays as tensor data.

## Differences
The main differences between this and [TensorFlow.NET](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET) and TensorSharp and other .NET TensorFlow projects are:
* tf.NET supports TensorFlow 2 only. TensorFlow.NET and other libraries currently only support TF 1.
* tf.NET does not try to implement any higher-level APIs for ML or things like that. I made this because I wanted a low-level direct binding to the TensorFlow 2 API that I could use to create my own .NET [scientific computing language](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/tree/master/src/Fabrics/tf) in F#. Looking at the code for TensorFlow.NET, it seems to me that it mixes a lot of higher-level C# code and the bindings together.
tf.NET has implementations of essential memory-backed objects like [buffers](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/blob/master/src/Fabrics/tf/Sylvester.tf.Api/Buffer.cs) and [tensors](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/blob/master/src/Fabrics/tf/Sylvester.tf.Api/Tensor.cs)
but usage of these implementations is purely optional.

## Installation
Available from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/tf.NET)
```sh
PM> Install-Package tf.NET
```

Note that you will still need the TensorFlow 2 native runtime library (i.e. libtensorflow) for your OS. There doesn't seem to be an official Google libtensorflow package for version 2 as yet. For Windows you can build it yourself or check out this [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sylvester.tf.Native.Win/) which installs a CPU-only TF 2 native library dependency into your .NET project. For Linux you can download [nightly builds](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow-nightly/github/tensorflow/lib_package/libtensorflow-cpu-linux-x86_64.tar.gz) of libtensorflow from the TensorFlow [Github](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/c) page.

For usage examples see the [unit tests](https://github.com/allisterb/Sylvester/blob/master/tests/Sylvester.Tests.tf/Api/TFGraphTests.fs).
